The Astrobook
=============

Welcome to the official webpage of **The Astrobook**, an open-source book on
orbital mechanics and astrodynamics.  Main objective of this work is to be a
reference in the orbital mechanics field and accessible anywhere where Ethernet
connection exists.


Why this book?
--------------

**Academical and technical books are usually pretty expensive** from the point of
view of students budget. Old book versions might contain outdated content or
some kind of errata, forcing reader to have always the latest edition. **By
having online materials like The Astrobook, content is always up to date.**

Another reason behind writing this book is **learning while teaching.** Writing
a simple section or chapter might be the final result of a deep search and study
on a particular topic, increasing not only authors knowledge but community also.

Finally, a **modern approach** is also applied: different **computer
algorithms** are presented to readers as other daily used tools, always keeping
in mind open-source features.


About its content
-----------------

```{warning}
The Astrobook is still under heavy maintenance although very active.
```

**The idea of this volume is to serve as a reference one in the orbital mechanics
field, something very ambitious and still far from reality.** 

First chapters of the book provide provide a quick introduction to astronomy and
main Solar System bodies. Then, basic topics such us two body problem, orbits
geometry, position as function of time, maneuvers, patched conics and many
others are also presented.

In order to provide also **practical knowledge**, different examples are provided
among each section as topics are introduced to reader. **A collection of exercises
is provided at the end of each chapter also for reader.**


How to contribute
-----------------

**Anyone can contribute to the project**, no matter its nature or academical
knowledge **as long as contributions are original and mathematically correct.**
Contributions might be classified in the following categories:

* **Content**: related with technical knowledge. This category includes chapter
    writing, figures design, exercises creation and anything that has to do with
    final printable version of the book.

* **Maintenance**: related with control version and online support. Everything
    related with the process of converting previously created content files with
    its final rendering and presentation in this official webpage.

```{tip}
Refer to [official source code files](https://github.com/astrobook/astrobook) or
[deployed webpage repository](https://github.com/astrobook/astrobook.github.io)
respectively. Developers can access issues section for more information about
bugs and new desired features.
```

Although control version such us Git is expected to be known by contributors
together with GitHub workflow, information can be directly passed in plain text
format and merged in source files by authorized people working on the project.
Original author for the contribution will be kept.
