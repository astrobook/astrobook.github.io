Why this book?
--------------

Academical and technical books are usually pretty expensive from the point of
view of students budget. Old book versions might contain outdated content or
some kind of errata, forcing reader to have always the latest edition. **By
having online materials like The Astrobook, content is always up to date.**

Another reason behind writing this book is **learning while teaching.** Writing
a simple section or chapter might be the final result of a deep searching and
study on a particular topic, increasing not only authors knowledge but community
also.

Finally, a modern approach is also applied: different computer algorithms are
presented to final readers to clarify how to obtain desired data being given
some initial parameters.
